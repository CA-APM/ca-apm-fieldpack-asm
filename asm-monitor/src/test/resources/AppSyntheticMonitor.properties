#################################
# Login Configuration
#
# Enter the email address and password for the ASM account that will enable
# the fieldpack to access the ASM API. To # encrypt the password in this file,
# run "encryptPassword.[bat|sh] your_password" at command line, enter the
# result here, and set "asm.APIPasswordEncrypted=true".
#
# Example: After running "encryptPassword.bat myPassword"
#          asm.APIPassword=fBckRZ2hrQnQfJY7nCA9zQ==
#          asm.passwordEncrypted=true

#################################
# Proxy Configuration
#
# If your agent requires a proxy server to reach https://api.watchmouse.com, fill in the settings below. 
# Your username and password are not required, unless your proxy requires them for authentication.
#
# To use an encrypted password, run "encryptPassword.[bat|sh] your_password" at command line to produce an 
# encrypted password. Then enter the result here, and set "asm.proxyPasswordEncrypted=true"
#
# Example: encryptPassword.bat TestPassword1
#   asm.proxy.pass=fBckRZ2hrQnQfJY7nCA9zQ==
#   asm.proxy.pass.encrypted=true

#####################################
# Filter Monitor results by ASM Folder(s), tags, and Monitor name pattern match.
#
# Set filters to process test results from specific ASM folders, tags, and monitor name patterns. The default behavior
# is to process test results from every folder accessibile to the API user account and Monitors not in folders. 
# Note: these filters control which monitor report metrics to Introscope. They do not control whether the Monitors run
# their tests.
# 
# ASM folders have the highest precedent for filtering. The fieldpack looks for Monitor results only in folders
# included in the search criteria, regardless of other match criteria. If specific tag names are configured, the 
# fieldpack searches inside included folders for Monitors with matching tags. Finally, if Monitor name patterns
# are specified, the fieldpack searches for Monitors with matching names for the remaining Monitors.
#
# Note: To include Monitors not inside ASM folders when not using the value "all_folders", use the folder name 
# "no_folder" in the list of folders to include.
#
# Monitor name patterns are specified using perl-style regular expressions. E.g., for all Monitor names starting with
# the string "AppName1-", use the regular expression "AppName1-.*". Ensure that all reserved characters are escaped 
# properly. [TO DO: Determine the character escaping requirementss and list them here.]
#
# [TO DO: Determine if we should have inclusion and exclusion criteria, e.g., exclude montiors in these folders...]
#
# Format: 
#   asm.includeFolders=[all_folders|[no_folder,]folderName,folderName,...]
#   asm.includeTags=[all_tags|tagName,tagName...]
#   asm.includeMonitors=[all_monitors|monitorNamePattern,monitorNamePattern...]
#
# Examples:
#   asm.includeFolders=all_folders
#   -- OR --
#   asm.includeFolders=FolderName1,FolderName2,Foldername3
#   -- OR --
#   asm.includeFolders=no_folder,FolderName1,FolderName2
#   --------------------------------------------------------------
#   asm.includeTags=all_tags
#   -- OR --
#   asm.includeTags=tagName1,tagName2,tagName3
#   --------------------------------------------------------------
#   asm.includeMonitors=all_monitors
#   -- OR --
#   asm.includeMonitors="monitorName1","NamePrefix-.*",".*-NameSuffix"
#
 asm.includeFolders=all_folders
 asm.includeTags=all_tags
 asm.includeMonitors=all_monitors
 
#####################################
# Group Monitor results by folders or by Monitoring Station.
#
# Configure how the fieldpack groups monitor results in the Introscope metric tree: by ASM folders, by 
# Monitoring Station, mixed, or with no grouping. The default behavior is to group by ASM folder regardless 
# of where the Monitor test ran (including on an On-Premise Monitoring Station). Specify "mixed" if you want
# to group Monitors running on CA-hosted ASM Monitoring Stations grouped by location and Monitors running on
# an OPMS grouped by ASM folder. Specify "by_station" if you want all monitors grouped by the station they
# ran on (including on an OPMS).
#
# [TO DO: Determine whether other options (such as by tag or name pattern) or nested groups are useful.]
# 
# Format: 
#   asm.resultsGroups=[by_folder|by_station|mixed|no_groups]
#
# Examples:
#   asm.resultsGroups=by_folder
#   -- OR --
#   asm.resultsGroups=mixed
#
asm.resultsGroups=by_folder
#asm.displayMonitoringStations=false
 
#######################################
# Skip inactive ASM folder and Monitors
#
# Set one or both property to "true" to prevent polling for metrics from inactive folders and monitors. This filter is
# not dependent on other filter critera.

asm.skipInactiveFolders=true
asm.skipInactiveMonitors=true

######################################
# Report test step results for Script Monitors (i.e., JMeter tests).
#
# Set the first parameter to "true" to report each JMeter step results individually in the Introscope metrics tree. The
# default behavior is to report the whole test as one result. Set the second parameter to a list of HTTP response codes 
# indicating JMeter steps to not report to Introscope. E.g., to suppress JMeter redirect steps indicated by a 301 or 303
# response codes: asm.suppressStepsWithCodes=301,303
#
asm.reportJMeterSteps=true
# asm.suppressStepsWithCodes=

######################################
# Response code translation
#
# Use these properties to translate HTTP response codes into other numeric values. Useful if you want to combine HTTP
# response codes (such as 301->200) to simplify reporting. You can also report HTTP response codes as any integer
# (such as 0, 3, -1, etc). If JMeter step result resporting is configured, this translation extends to each step's HTTP
# response code.
#
# [TO DO: Determine if this is the best way to handle this. Maybe the other way around?]
#
# Format: asm.HTTPResponseCodes=301,304,505
#         asm.HTTPResponseCode.301=200
#         asm.HTTPResponseCode.304=1
#         etc...
#
# asm.HTTPResponseCodes=

######################################
# Assertion results translation
#
# Use these properties to translate Monitor assertion results into numeric values that replace the HTTP response code for
# test results and JMeter script steps. This may simplify reporting and alerting if you treat assertion failures and HTTP
# error codes in the same way. Often tests or test steps will return the response code 200 when the test failed because of
# an assertion failure.
#
# Note: If reporting JMeter script steps, an assertion failure in a test step will also set the response code for the 
# entire test to the same translated number.
#
# Format: asm.reportAssertFailureAs=404
#         asm.reportAssertFailureAs=3
#         etc...
#
# asm.reportAssertionFailureAs=

#########################################
# Report string result metrics
#
# By default, the fieldpack will report a numeric result for each test (or JMeter test step), possibly translated by the
# monitors above. Setting this parameter to "true" creates a string metric below each numeric test result metric, containing 
# additional information about the test result. E.g., 404 -> "404 - Not Found", and for assertion failures, the assertion
# results string, e.g., "Assertion Failure: string <assertion_string> not found".
#
asm.reportStringResults=false

#########################################
# Suppress ASM errors in Monitor results
#
# ASM reports several error codes (1000-9999) for ASM-related problems, not regarding the application being tested. E.g.,
# "Wrong credentials", "Account limit exceeded", and "Session expired". This parameter suppresses the results from the
# test being executed when the ASM issue occurs and instead logs the issue in the fieldpack log file. This enables ASM 
# issues to be handled separately from application test errors. The default value is "false".
#
asm.logASMIssues=false


######################################
# [TO DO: Determine which ASM health and account-related metrics to include.]
